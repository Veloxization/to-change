# To Change (Unofficial)
A FoundryVTT system implementation for playing the [To Change](https://usducktape.itch.io/to-change) system by Duck and Ewen.

All official artwork shipped with the system belongs to its respective owners and is used with permission.

## Getting started
The system implementation comes with basic rules included in a compendium pack, including character creation, information on Attributes and rules on action resolution. If you want to learn the full rules and gain access to the Stories included within, you can purchase the To Change rulebook from [Itch.io](https://usducktape.itch.io/to-change) or from any of the retailers listed on the game's page.

The Future Deck and an empty Discard pile also come included as a compendium pack with the system. Make sure to import the compendium pack to use it.
