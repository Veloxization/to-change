# To Change (Unofficial)
A FoundryVTT system implementation for playing the [To Change](https://usducktape.itch.io/to-change) system by Duck and Ewen.

All official artwork shipped with the system belongs to its respective owners and is used with permission.

## Getting started
The system implementation comes with basic rules included in a compendium package, including character creation, information on Attributes and rules on action resolution. If you want to learn the full rules and gain access to the Stories included within, you can purchase the To Change rulebook from [Itch.io](https://usducktape.itch.io/to-change) or from any of the retailers listed on the game's page.

For the Future Deck, you can implement your own Major Arcana deck using Foundry's built-in Card Stacks feature, or use one provided by a module such as [Ready To Use Cards](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ready-to-use-cards). Use of Ready To Use Cards is recommended with this system for a more immersive experience and more deck controls.

## Installation
For now, the system is not available through FoundryVTT packages. You can install the package using this manifest URL: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Veloxization/to-change/main/system.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Veloxization/to-change/main/system.json)
